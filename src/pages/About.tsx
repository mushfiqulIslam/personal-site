                My journey in software engineering began during my undergraduate studies at BRAC University, where I discovered my passion for building scalable systems and analyzing data. Throughout my academic career, I focused on developing strong foundations in computer science and mathematics, which later became the cornerstone of my work in machine learning and data science.

                As I progressed in my career, I moved to Tirzok Private Limited, where I expanded my skills in microservices architecture and enterprise resource planning systems. This experience was crucial in shaping my understanding of large-scale software systems and how different components interact.

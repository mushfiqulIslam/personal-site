# Overview
Most Finnish universities allow international students to apply through centralized online portals. The two main portals are:

- [Studyinfo.fi](https://studyinfo.fi/)
- [Joint Application Period](https://studyinfo.fi/en/) — typically starts in January each year.

Applications for Bachelor’s and Master’s degree programmes follow this centralized process, especially for English-taught programmes.

# Step-by-Step Process

## Step 1: Research Programs and Universities

- Go to [Studyinfo.fi](https://studyinfo.fi/) and browse available programmes.
- Focus on English-taught programmes under Bachelor's and Master’s degrees. 

**Check specific programme requirements**:
  - Language proficiency (IELTS/TOEFL/PTE or equivalent).
  - Previous education level and GPA requirements.
  - Programme-specific entrance exams or interviews.

**Examples of top universities**:
  - University of Helsinki
  - Aalto University
  - Tampere University
  - University of Jyväskylä
  - LAB University of Applied Sciences
  - JAMK University of Applied Sciences

## Step 2: Understand Tuition Fees and Scholarships

- **Non-EU/EEA students:** Tuition fees usually apply.
- **EU/EEA students:** Generally, no tuition fees.

Fee ranges (as of 2025):
> - Applied Sciences Universities: €6,000–€12,000 per year.
> - Research Universities: €10,000–€18,000 per year.

**Scholarships:**
> - Most universities offer scholarships covering 50–100% of tuition fees.
> - You usually apply for a scholarship along with your degree application via Studyinfo.fi.

## Step 3: Prepare Application Documents

Commonly required documents:
- Valid passport or national ID card.
- Degree certificates and official transcripts.
- Proof of English proficiency: IELTS Academic 6.5 overall score is commonly required for most English-taught programmes.
- Motivation letter or statement of purpose.
- CV/resume.
- Portfolio (for design/art-related programmes).

Note:  
> - Having subject-related job experience can strengthen your application, especially for Master’s programmes.
> - Mention relevant work experience clearly in your CV and motivation letter. 

## Step 4: Submit Application via Studyinfo.fi

- Create an account at [Studyinfo.fi](https://studyinfo.fi/).
- Fill in personal details, educational background, and programme choices.
- Upload required documents in PDF format.
- Submit the application before the Joint Application period deadline.

Important Notes on Joint Application and Fees:
> - You can apply to **up to 5 different study programmes/universities** with a **single application form** during the Joint Application period.
> - Starting **January 1, 2025**, a **€100 application fee** applies to all non-EU/EEA applicants for Bachelor’s and Master’s degree programmes in Finland.
> - This fee applies per application round, covering all degree programme choices in that round.
> - **Exceptions:** No fee is required for Doctoral degrees or Erasmus Mundus programmes.
> - Always check [Studyinfo.fi](https://studyinfo.fi/) and each university’s website for the most up-to-date information.

For **research-oriented programmes** or some Master’s programmes you may be asked to submit a short introduction video (typically 1–3 minutes) explaining:
> - Who you are.
> - Why you want to join the programme.
> - Your research interests and relevant experience.


## Step 5: Monitor Application Status and Additional Requirements

You might be invited for an entrance exam or online interview depending on the programme. Check the result date and stay updated. Results are usually published by the end of March or early April. If accepted:
- Confirm your study place via Studyinfo.fi.
- The confirmation link will be send to your email by Studyinfo.fi.
- Upon accepting one university’s admissin rest of the study place will be cancelled.
- Follow the university’s instructions for tuition fee payment and final document verification.

## Step 6: Pay Tuition Fee and Secure Scholarship

Pay the first year’s tuition fees promptly, as missing the **payment deadline** can result in losing your **admission spot**. Try to utilize the **early bird tuition fee waiver**, which is mostly offered for programs without **scholarships**. **Scholarship confirmation** typically comes with the **admission result**. After the initial screening, universities may request **certified copies** or additional documents by post or through an **online channel**—so collect and prepare these as soon as you receive a **positive decision**. You can easily **certify and verify** your academic and personal documents through the [**My Gov**](https://www.mygov.bd/) portal, an official government service for **document authentication and certification**.


Note:
I find sending online attested documents is easier because it contains QR codes and entire process can be 
done onine. 

## Step 7: Accept Admission and Prepare for Residence Permit

- Once admission and tuition fee payment are confirmed, begin your residence permit application.
- Gather all required documents for the residence permit, including the admission letter and payment receipt.
- If you are married, check your marriage certificate and nid information. This document will be assesed incase
you appy for your spuse residence permit.
